Email_proof 
I have search trough the web site of my university and was unable to find 
a direct reference as acknowledgement of correo.estudiantes.uci.cu email 
domain as the official email for students. Nevertheless i will attach a 
screenshoot of my student inbox. 
My student email is djanaya@estudiantes.uci.cu ,  i hope this info will be 
good enough, but if it's not the case let me know how can i help you help 
me and my fellow students.

And thanks a lot for have such nice policy of help students to progress.
There is some good human beens behind the Idea curtain.
